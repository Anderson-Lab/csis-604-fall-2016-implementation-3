Show that everything is working correctly, but running the SimpleShortestPathsComputation sample (http://giraph.apache.org/quick_start.html).\r\n\r\n# Part 2 (50%)\r\nNow we are going to implement Page Rank on giraph! Page Rank is one of the most famous algorithm. Here is a walk through of the theory of the algorithm and it even includes an implementation in Python: http://www.ccs.northeastern.edu/home/daikeshi/notes/PageRank.pdf. \r\n\r\nThree is a partial tutorial that will help you started: http://giraph.apache.org/pagerank.html.\r\n\r\nThis video is also good to watch in addition to lots of other good online resources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq_Rt6hNvFE\r\n\r\nUpdate: So it turns out giraph does have a working pagerank algorithm and benchmark. Instead of writing it from scratch then, once you get this example working in your setup, do a write-up about the giraph specific algorithm itself. You can find the code in the source code for the examples, which should be something like: giraph-examples/src/main/java/org/apache/giraph/examples/SimplePageRankComputation.java.",
  "note": "Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."
